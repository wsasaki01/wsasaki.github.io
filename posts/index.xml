      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Will, and I&amp;rsquo;m learning to make games.
This blog will feature my development experience across projects, including design, programming, and releasing builds to the public.
The past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to use PICO-8 (a fantasy game console), and Lua, releasing two games for the console.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning how to use Unity while redesigning one of my PICO-8 games, Icebreaker.
Icebreaker Gameplay I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner when it comes to C#, Unity and game design in general, so I want this blog to be a collection of the skills I learn and a record of my progress as I get to grips with game dev.</description>
